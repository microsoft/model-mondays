# Model Mondays S2E12: Models & Observability

Welcome to Episode 12! This week, we explored observability for AI agents and models in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/). From monitoring and evaluation to real-world compliance use cases, this episode showed how you can confidently build, deploy, and govern AI solutions for regulated industries.

## 2. Spotlight On: Observability in Azure AI Foundry

_This week’s spotlight featured a deep dive and demo by Han (Senior PM, Core AI), showing observability end-to-end for agent workflows._

**Why Observability?**  
- Ensures AI quality, performance, and safety throughout the development lifecycle.
- Enables monitoring, root cause analysis, optimization, and governance for agents and models.

**Key Features & Demos:**

- **Development Lifecycle:**  
  - **Leaderboard:** Pick the best model for your agent with real-time evaluation.
  - **Playground:** Chat and prototype agents, view instant quality and safety metrics.
  - **Evaluators:** Assess quality, risk, safety, intent resolution, tool accuracy, code vulnerability, and custom metrics. 
  - **Governance:** Integrate with partners like Cradle AI and SideDot for policy mapping and evidence archiving.
  - **Red Teaming Agent:** Automatically test for vulnerabilities and unsafe behavior. [
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Automate evaluation in GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps pipelines.  
    - [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/)
    - [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- **Monitoring Dashboard:**  
  - Resource usage, application analytics, input/output tokens, request latency, cost breakdown, and evaluation scores. [Azure Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)
- **SDKs & Local Evaluation:**  
  - Run evaluations locally or in the cloud with the [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/evaluation).

**Demo Highlights:**
- Chat with a travel planning agent, view run metrics and tool usage.
- Drill into run details, debugging, and real-time safety/quality scores.
- Configure and run large-scale agent evaluations in CI/CD pipelines.
- Compare agents, review statistical analysis, and monitor in production dashboards.

## 3. Customer Story: Safer (Fidelity Labs)

_This week’s customer spotlight featured [Safer](https://safer.ai/), a RegTech company incubated at Fidelity Labs, helping financial services stay compliant with AI._

**How Safer Uses Azure AI:**
- **Compliance Guardrails for Content:**  
  Proprietary models and agents check text, images, audio, and video for regulatory compliance before publishing.
- **Agentic Workflows:**  
  AI agents proactively review, flag, and suggest compliant language for communications, marketing, and sales materials.
- **Model Catalog on Foundry:**  
  Four models available: retail compliance, suggested language, risk explanation, and non-compliant image detection.
- **OpenAPI Integration:**  
  Models are exposed as [OpenAPI 3.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) endpoints, enabling easy agent/tool creation and integration in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/).
- **Multimodal Coverage:**  
  Beyond text: image, audio, and video compliance checks.

**Impact:**  
Accelerates compliant content review by 70-90%, gets content to market 10x faster with confidence, and reduces risk for regulated industries.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

I focus on organizing highlights, summarizing customer stories, and linking to official Microsoft docs and real working resources. For this recap, I explored the [Azure AI Foundry Observability docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview), tested CI/CD pipeline integration, and watched the customer demo to share best practices for regulated industries.

Here’s my Copilot prompt for this episode:

> "Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E12 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on observability, agent dashboards, CI/CD, compliance, and customer stories. Add correct, working Microsoft links!"
