# Model Mondays S2E12: Models & Observability

Welcome to Episode 12! This week, we explored observability for AI agents and models in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/). From monitoring and evaluation to real-world compliance use cases, this episode showed how you can confidently build, deploy, and govern AI solutions for regulated industries.

## 1. Weekly Highlights

_This week’s top news in the Azure AI ecosystem included:_

- **GPT Real Time (GA):**  
  Azure AI Foundry now offers GPT Real Time (GA)—lifelike voices, improved instruction following, audio fidelity, and function calling, with support for image context and lower pricing. [Read the announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/announcing-gpt-realtime-on-azure-ai-foundry/4449666) and [check out the model card](https://aka.ms/gpt-realtime/) for more details.
- **Azure AI Translator API (Public Preview):**  
  Choose between fast Neural Machine Translation (NMT) or nuanced LLM-powered translations, with real-time flexibility for multilingual workflows. [Read the announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/announcing-a-new-azure-ai-translator-api-public-preview/4450660) then check out the [Azure AI Translator documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/) for more details.
- **Azure AI Foundry Agents Learning Plan:**  
  Build agents with autonomous goal pursuit, memory, collaboration, and deep fine-tuning (SFT, RFT, DPO) - on Azure AI Foundry. [Read the announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/azure-ai-foundry-agents-build-intelligent-goal-driven-ai-that-acts-autonomously/4450449) what Agentic AI involves - then follow [this comprehensive learning plan](https://aka.ms/CreateAgenticAISolutions) with step-by-step guidance.
- **CalcLM Agent Grid (Azure AI Foundry Labs):**  
  Project CalcLM: Agent Grid is a prototype and open-source experiment that illustrates how agents might live in a grid-like surface (like Excel). It's formula-first and lightweight - defining agentic workflows like calculations. [Try the prototype](https://calclm.azurewebsites.net/) and [visit Foundry Labs](https://ai.azure.com/labs/projects/calclm) to learn more.
- **Agent Factory Blog: Observability in Agentic AI:**  
  Agentic AI tools and workflows are gaining rapid adoption in the enterprise. But delivering safe, reliable and performant agents requires foundation support for Observability. [Read the 6-part Agent Factory series](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tag/agent-factory/) and check out the [Top 5 agent observability best practices for reliable AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/agent-factory-top-5-agent-observability-best-practices-for-reliable-ai/) blog post for more details.

## 2. Spotlight On: Observability in Azure AI Foundry

_This week’s spotlight featured a deep dive and demo by Han (Senior PM, Core AI), showing observability end-to-end for agent workflows._

**Why Observability?**  
- Ensures AI quality, performance, and safety throughout the development lifecycle.
- Enables monitoring, root cause analysis, optimization, and governance for agents and models.

**Key Features & Demos:**

- **Development Lifecycle:**  
  - **Leaderboard:** Pick the best model for your agent with real-time evaluation.
  - **Playground:** Chat and prototype agents, view instant quality and safety metrics.
  - **Evaluators:** Assess quality, risk, safety, intent resolution, tool accuracy, code vulnerability, and custom metrics. 
  - **Governance:** Integrate with partners like Cradle AI and SideDot for policy mapping and evidence archiving.
  - **Red Teaming Agent:** Automatically test for vulnerabilities and unsafe behavior. [
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Automate evaluation in GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps pipelines.  
    - [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/)
    - [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- **Monitoring Dashboard:**  
  - Resource usage, application analytics, input/output tokens, request latency, cost breakdown, and evaluation scores. [Azure Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)
- **SDKs & Local Evaluation:**  
  - Run evaluations locally or in the cloud with the [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/evaluation).

**Demo Highlights:**
- Chat with a travel planning agent, view run metrics and tool usage.
- Drill into run details, debugging, and real-time safety/quality scores.
- Configure and run large-scale agent evaluations in CI/CD pipelines.
- Compare agents, review statistical analysis, and monitor in production dashboards.
