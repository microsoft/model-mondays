# Model Mondays S2E8: On-Device & Local AI 

Welcome to Episode 8! This week, we explored how AI is moving from the cloud to your own device, making it faster, more private, and more accessible. We also saw a real-world customer story from Xander Glasses, showing how AI can help people with hearing loss.

### 1. Weekly Highlights
- RFD Observability tools in Azure AI Foundry: Real-time model telemetry, auto evals, quick evals, Python grader.
- GitHub Copilot Pro with Spark: AI pair programmer for code explanation and workflow suggestions.
- Synthetic Data for Vision Models: Training accurate models with procedurally generated data.
- Agent-Friendly Websites: Making sites accessible to AI agents via APIs, semantic markup, and OpenAPI specs.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Standardizing agent memory and context for scalable AI.

### 2. Spotlight: Foundry Local – On-Device AI
- **What is Foundry Local?**  
  A toolkit to run open-source AI models directly on your device (CPU, GPU, NPU) for fast, private, and efficient inference.
- **Why does it matter?**  
  Developers can work with data locally, switch seamlessly between local and cloud, and leverage rich tooling (CLI, SDK, REST API).
- **Demo Highlights:**  
  - Install Foundry Local ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/foundry-local))
  - List and run models on device
  - Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with local documents
  - Monitor deployments and cache models
  - Integrate with VS Code and GitHub Copilot ([AI Toolkit for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-ai-foundry.ai-toolkit))

### 3. Customer Story: Xander Glasses
- **Problem:**  
  Real-time captioning for people with hearing loss, especially in noisy environments or where Wi-Fi/cloud is unreliable.
- **Solution:**  
  Smart glasses with embedded Microsoft Speech SDK ([Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/)), running speech-to-text locally for instant captions.
- **Innovation:**  
  Using generative AI to simplify captions for users with cognitive disabilities, and supporting multiple languages and translation features.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

Writing this blog felt like sharing my own learning journey with friends. After watching the episode, I realized how much easier Azure development can be with tools like MCP Server and GitHub Copilot for Azure. The demos and real-world stories made everything click for me, and I wanted to pass that clarity on to you.

I started by thinking about why this topic matters and how it could help someone new to Azure. I tried to explain things in a way that’s easy to understand, using simple language and real examples from the episode. To organize my thoughts and make sure I didn’t miss anything important, I used GitHub Copilot.

Here’s the prompt I gave Copilot to help me draft this blog:

> Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E8 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on Foundry Local, Xander Glasses, and real-world demos. Explain the concept for students, add a section on practical applications, and share tips for writing technical blogs. Make it clear, engaging, and useful for developers and students.

After watching the video, I felt inspired to try out these tools myself. The way the speakers explained and demonstrated everything made me believe that anyone can get started, no matter their background. My goal with this blog is to help you feel the same way—curious, confident, and ready to explore what AI and Azure can do for you. If you have questions or want to share your own experience, I’d love to hear from you.
