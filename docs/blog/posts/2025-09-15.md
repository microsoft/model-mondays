# Model Mondays S2E13: Open Source Models & Community AI

![Model Mondays S2E13 Banner - Open Source Models & Community AI](/img/model-mondays-banner.png)

Welcome to Episode 13—the grand finale of Model Mondays Season 2!  This week we celebrated the power of open-source AI with live demos, new workflows, and a special guest: **Jeff Boudier**, VP of Product at Hugging Face.  If you want to see how open models, community collaboration, and Azure AI Foundry work together to accelerate innovation, this recap is for you.

## 1. Weekly Highlights

Here are the key updates we covered in the Season 2 finale:

1. **O1 Mini Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (GA)**  
   Fine-tune models with as few as ~100 samples using built-in Python code graders.

2. **Azure Live Interpreter API (Preview)**  
   Real-time speech-to-speech translation supporting 76 input languages and 143 locales with near human-level latency.

3. **Agent Factory – Part 5**  
   Connecting agents using open standards like **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol)**.

4. **Ask Ralph by Ralph Lauren**  
   A retail example of agentic AI for conversational styling assistance, built on Azure OpenAI and Foundry’s agentic toolset.

5. **VS Code August Release**  
   Brings auto-model selection, stronger safety guards for sensitive edits, and improved agent workflows through new `agents.md` support.

## 2. Spotlight – Open Source Models in Azure AI Foundry

**Guest:** Jeff Boudier, VP of Product at Hugging Face

Jeff showcased the deep integration between the Hugging Face community and Azure AI Foundry, where developers can access **over 10 000 open-source models** across multiple modalities—LLMs, speech recognition, computer vision, and even specialized domains like protein modeling and robotics.

**Demo Highlights**

- **Discover** models through Azure AI Foundry’s task-based catalog filters.  
- **Deploy** directly from Hugging Face Hub to Azure with one-click deployment.  
- **Explore Use Cases** such as multilingual speech recognition and vision-language-action models for robotics.

Jeff also highlighted notable models, including:

- **SmoLM3** – a 3 B-parameter model with hybrid reasoning capabilities  
- **Qwen 3 Coder** – a mixture-of-experts model optimized for coding tasks  
- **Parakeet ASR** – multilingual speech recognition  
- **Microsoft Research protein-modeling collection**  
- **MAGMA** – a vision-language-action model for robotics

Integration extends beyond deployment to programmatic access through the **Azure CLI** and **Python SDKs**, plus local development via new **VS Code extensions**.

## 3. Customer Story – DraftWise (BUILD 2025 Segment)

The finale featured a customer spotlight on **DraftWise**, where CEO James Ding shared how the company accelerates contract drafting with Azure AI Foundry.

**Problem**  
Legal contract drafting is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Solution**  
DraftWise uses Azure AI Foundry to fine-tune Hugging Face language models on legal data, generating contract drafts and redline suggestions.

**Impact**

- Faster drafting cycles and higher consistency  
- Easy model management and deployment with Foundry’s secure workflows  
- Transparent evaluation for legal compliance

## 4. Community Story – Hugging Face & Microsoft

The episode also celebrated the ongoing collaboration between Hugging Face and Microsoft and the impact of open-source AI on the global developer ecosystem.

**Community Benefits**

- **Access to State-of-the-Art Models** without licensing barriers  
- **Transparent Performance** through public leaderboards and benchmarks  
- **Rapid Innovation** as improvements and bug fixes spread quickly  
- **Education & Empowerment** via tutorials, docs, and active forums  
- **Responsible AI Practices** encouraged through community oversight

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

1. **Open Source AI Is Here to Stay**  
   Azure AI Foundry and Hugging Face make deploying, fine-tuning, and benchmarking open models easier than ever.

2. **Community Drives Innovation**  
   Collaboration accelerates progress, improves transparency, and makes AI accessible to everyone.

3. **Responsible AI and Transparency**  
   Open-source models come with clear documentation, licensing, and community-driven best practices.

4. **Easy Deployment & Customization**  
   Azure AI Foundry lets you deploy, automate, and customize open models from a single, unified platform.

5. **Learn, Build, Share**  
   The open-model ecosystem is a great place for students, developers, and researchers to learn, build, and share their work.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

For this final recap, I focused on capturing the energy of the open-source AI movement and the practical impact of the Hugging Face–Azure AI Foundry collaboration.  
I watched the livestream, cross-checked the official slide deck, and linked directly to authoritative resources for models, docs, and community sites.

Here’s the Copilot prompt I used:

> “Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E13 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on open-source models, Hugging Face, Azure AI Foundry, and community workflows. Include practical links and actionable insights for developers and students.”
