Please choose the same 2 weeks for family time where they won’t be in camps.  These 2 weeks don’t have to be consecutive; just pick any two weeks for all 3 kids to be off at the same time.  Here is information about each kid so you can choose the best camps for them.  Tori is 16 (entering grade 12) and loves baking and dance.  Fiona is 12 (entering grade 8) and enjoys reading, writing, and soccer.  Gabe is 10 (entering grade 5) and loves martial arts, superheroes, and video games, especially Minecraft and Roblox.  They all love swimming.  I’m open to exploring other classes they may enjoy, but please make sure they each have at least 2 classes involving these above activities they love.  They should take a different class each week (no duplicates of the same class for the same kid).  Your output should be a matrix of each week of the summer by each kid, and what they are doing that week (either the title of the camp class they would enjoy, or a family time week where they are all off together).  \n",
